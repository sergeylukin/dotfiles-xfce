2011.05.23 (v10)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a pretty massive update of things I've been playing with for some time now - updates for XFCE, LXDE, Gnome 2, Gnome 3, and Ubuntu 11.04. I've reworked a lot of things, some completely, including the dark panels, dark menus, window borders, and pathbar breadcrumb expanders. This is now a full XFCE and LXDE theme, as both have recieved updates and fixes, as well as a complete set of window borders for both. The theme has also been updated for Ubuntu 11.04's Unity Panel and Indicator Applet, and I've started the work on creating a Gnome 3 version of the theme. The Gnome 3 theme is in what might be called alpha-stage - it's a little rough and early, but it should blend well with existing Gtk 2 apps. The Opera theme has been updated*, and new Google Chrome/Chromium themes have been added. The Victory Icon Theme has been updated quite a bit with a whole new set of monochrome panel/indicator applet icons (Pithos, Transmission, Weather Indicator) for dark panels. Read the included Changelog for a few more details.

The Opera theme has to be reviewed before it's published on the Opera site... so those who use Opera (all 3 of us) may have to wait a few days for that.

2010.12.02 (v7)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

New
+ Victory Icon Collection
-- http://newhoa.deviantart.com/art/Victory-Icon-Collection-188206119
-- Icon collection/modification using NuoveXT and elementary icons.
-- Leave comments here or at the link above, if people seem interested, I'll try to continue to fix/improve it.

General
+ Small adjustments and fixes
-- Toolbar has a little less padding
-- Toolbar prelight lighter
-- Volume slider a little bigger
-- Sidebar triangle expanders smaller and softer
-- Expander triangles softer
-- Scrollbars lighter
-- Panel fixes

+ Updates for new/updated Apps
-- Banshee
-- mintMenu
-- Shotwell
-- Google Chrome (title bar colors now match window border)


-------------------------------------------------------------------
2010.08.08 (v6)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Victory Elementary
+ New Default Colors
+ New Window Border
-- New Colors
-- New Buttons

General (Both Victory and Victory Elementary)
+ Menus made a bit smaller/shorter
+ Toolbar top and bottom padding reduced
+ Toolbar prelight glow - brightness increased
+ Volume sliders more consistent
+ Sidebar scrollbars made to match other scrollbars, 1px wider
+ Updated for new releases: Cardapio/Banshee/Software Center
+ Expanders
-- Softened sidebar expanders
-- Changed some Tree View stuff *
--- This should improve the look of Transmission & other apps
+ Just more small stuff

* Last time I changed the triangle expanders for consistency throughout the theme. However, changing treeview expanders also changed treeview gradients/progress bars/checkmarks/dots/everything in treeview. Regardless of whether the treeview used expanders or not, it still distorted the look. Now there may be some treeviews that use murrine, and some that use pixmap for the triangle expander. This may cause some treeviews to have murrine +/- expanders. In the newer releases of murrine, it will default to triangles, so in the future, even if I don't change this, it will look more consistent. Try a newer murrine in Ubuntu here: https://launchpad.net/~suraia/+archive/ppa

Original Description
-------------------------------

Something bothering me lately was that many of the newer themes being released seem to be 'locked.' That is to say, they have hard coded colors and elements. I wanted to make a theme that:

1) Was not distracting.
2) Was not boring.
3) Was not completely ugly.
4) Could be used with many Window borders, and any user chosen color.

Having found success in only one of four goals*... It seems accomplished enough for me. VICTORY! (?) So pick any combination of colors, pick a window border, and enjoy.

Any feedback would be great. I have never done anything like this, so there may be a lot of problems with it... Let me know what you think, what you like, what you dislike. Thanks!

- Darin

*Goal 3 met: only slightly ugly.

The following applications are themed so far:

Nautilus & Nautilus Elementary
Thunar
PCManFM
Exaile
Rhythmbox
Banshee
Totem
F-Spot
Eye of Gnome
Firefox
Google Chrome
Ubuntu Software Center
Evolution
Open/Save Dialog
Gnome Control Center
SUSE Application Browser
CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm)
Synaptic
Panel - Menus:		SUSE Slab (gnome-main-menu), Gnome Menu/Menubar, USP (Ubuntu System Panel), Cardapio, mintMenu
Panel - Applets:	Panflute
