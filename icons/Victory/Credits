Victory Icon Collection 1.5 by Darin

A Gnome icon theme pack collecting icons from, or using modified icons from, several different themes. A huge thanks to the authors below. Credit (and donations!) should go entirely to them for their incredible work, as very few icons in this pack were created by myself.

Content   : Calculator, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Remove (and other poorly made icons I can't think of right now)
